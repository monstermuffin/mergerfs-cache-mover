### v1.3 - 2025-03-27
- Major codebase restructuring and improvements (assisted by Claude AI):
  - Refactored monolithic script into modular package structure.
  - Split functionality into logical modules:
    - `filesystem.py`: Core filesystem operations and file gathering.
    - `mover.py`: File moving and transfer logic.
    - `cleanup.py`: Cleanup operations management.
    - `config.py`: Configuration handling.
    - `logging_setup.py`: Logging configuration.
    - `notifications.py`: Notification system

  - Added concurrent processing of hardlink groups.
  - Improved error handling and cleanup for hardlinked files.
- Added symlink support:
  - Handling of both absolute and relative symlinks.
  - Automatic target path adjustment for moved files.
  - Path resolution for symlinks within cache directory.
  - Cleanup and error handling for symlink operations.
- Improved logging:
  - Added logging for hardlink operations.
  - Added logging for symlink operations.
  - Better error reporting for link-related operations.
- Updated documentation:
  - Updated README with new features and examples.

### v1.2 - 2025-01-24
  - fix: Speed calculation overhaul
  - ci: Release workflow setup/test

### v1.1 - 2025-01-20
  - Apprise support added.

### v1.0 - 2025-01-17
  - Added Docker support with scheduling and process management.
  - Added empty cache mode by setting both THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE and TARGET_PERCENTAGE to 0.
  - Added hardcoded snapraid file/directory exclusions.
  - Added graceful shutdown handling for Docker containers.
  - Updated `load_config()` to handle Docker environment variable.
  - Added `docker-entrypoint.sh` for container scheduling.
  - Added Docker-specific process detection.
  - Added Docker environment variable configuration support.
  - Added Docker volume mount support for logs and configuration.
  - Added SCHEDULE option in config.yml (Docker-only).
  - Updated process detection for containerized environment.
  - Disabled auto-updates in Docker containers.
  - Enhanced logging for Docker operations.
  - Added Docker documentation.

### v0.98.7
 - Added a custom `HybridFormatter` class for more detailed logging of file move operations.
 - Implemented a new `set_git_dir()` function to set the Git directory environment variable.
 - Added support for specifying the update branch in the configuration (`UPDATE_BRANCH`).
 - Introduced excluded directories feature (`EXCLUDED_DIRS`in config). By default the `Snapraid` folder is excluded as there were instances of this being moved.
 - Added graceful shutdown handling using signal handlers (`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`). This could possibly use more work to be honest.
 - Implemented free space checking before file moves.
 - Enhanced `auto_update()` function with better error handling and logging.
 - Refactored `move_file()` function for better error handling and logging.
 - Addressed potential race condition in checking filesystem usage with a lock mechanism. This should have cleared log spamming by the threads too. 
 - Added validation to ensure `THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE` is greater than `TARGET_PERCENTAGE`.

 #### TODO:
 - Replace `os.walk()` with `os.scandir()`.

### v0.97
 - Re-added excluded dirs option. This is required as my Snapraid dir was moved with the content file. By default, the `snapraid` dir is now excluded. 
 - Fixed autoupdates not working when run automatically. 
 - Remove logging whilst gathering files as this was spamming the log and had no real use. 
 - Added check to ensure `THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE` is greater than `TARGET_PERCENTAGE`.

### v0.96.5
